# Fab

This project is made for a Fablab where it is possible to see the activities ,... and also to help the management of the 3D printing.

## MVC symfony / Backend

Run `symfony server:start` to launch the server then access it by `https://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## SPA angular symfony

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.18.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. You need also to launch the backend symfony server.

## Problem
There is still problems with the cors. I am working on the issue.
